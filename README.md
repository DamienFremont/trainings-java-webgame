java-webgame
============

This project is an open-source video strategy game, designed for web.

Its purpose is to practice java on a project, with a very small team, on free time, by using Java and Scrum method. So it's not the "state of the art" project but a typical 2010 java project. We are using Bootstrap, JSF2, JDBC in the main webapp and SpringMVC, SpringSecurity, SpringCore and Hibernate in the secondary webapp.
